Branch-and-bound and backtracking are methods to solve discrete
optimization problems. Algorithms based on the methods act by repeatedly splitting
problems into subproblems, evaluating them, and, for each subproblem, eventually
either arriving at a candidate solution or determining that no good
enough solution exists compared to the current best candidate. \\
The goal of the
presented work is to create a generic library that implements common
components of backtracking and branch-and-bound, allowing users to
implement just the problem-specific parts of their algorithm. \\
For the library implementation, the Rust programming language was selected,
primarily, for its rich type system. The efficiency of the library was tested
on two problems: the boolean satisfiability problem and the knapsack problem;
for both problems, library-based solvers were tested against solvers implemented
from scratch. \\
The comparison of the solvers demonstrated that the use of the library might lead to
lower performance but cleaner code (lower cyclomatic complexity).
Possible applications of the library besides its initial design purpose
are education and reliable computing.
