\label{chap:ack}

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Professor Nikolay V. Shilov for suggesting
the research topic and supervising this work.

I am also grateful to Professor Nikolai Kudasov for giving valuable advise on the library design,
to Alexander Kudasov for countless suggestions on Rust programming best practices, and
to Nikita Strygin for recommending to use an external library to reduce the code verbosity.
