\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chap:ack}

I would like to express my grattitude to:
Professor of Innopolis University \textbf{Nikolai Kudasov} for sharing valuable advise on the
library design, to Innopolis University Bachelor's student \textbf{Alexander Kudasov} for
countless suggestions on Rust programming best practices and for introducing me to the concept of
lending iterators, and to Innopolis University Master's student \textbf{Nikita Strygin}
for recommending me to use an external library to reduce library code verbosity.
